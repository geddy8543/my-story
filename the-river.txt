I come from the river; the water dank and deep. The swirling water and currents flowing. Past the factories and towns that dot my banks and live in my shadow. 
I grew up along the mighty Mississippi and was taught from a young age the power of the river. We spent summers boating and swimming, but my dad always warned me of the dangers of the currents and to never be complacent. Although the surface would often seem calm, below the depts the current would churn and could sweep you away.
